Description: The spotifywRapped package gives Spotify premium users control 
    over how and when they get to view their listening history. This package 
    depends on users having a Spotify premium account and data pulled from the
    Spotify API (perhaps using the spotifyr package). The spotifywRapped
    package lets the user specify a particular theme, or 'vibe', for their
    graphic of choice. A user has the option to choose between several types of
    graphics, like wordclouds visualizing their favorite artists, or an energy/
    valence plot describing their listening habits. The user can then save
    these graphics wherever they choose!
